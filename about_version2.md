## About Civitai Helper2: Model Info Helper
The first version of "Civitai Helper2" is already finished and I have used it for a while on my local machine. It works exactly as in the demo video I have released before.

But the developing process is extremely painful. Its maintenance will also be difficult and hard to hand it over to other developers. If I release it, with all those requests and issues from users, my life gonna be in hell.  

The reason for this is, the whole client side is based on javascript, almost no gradio code at all.  

Gradio is not suitable for a professional level's management system. But under gradio's framework and SD webui's design, a lot of javascript stuff won't work well.  

So, it is too painful that I don't want to do any further maintenance and development. And I realize SD webui itself is not that good since it uses gradio.  

In the meantime, a lot of alternatives become popular. For example, the latest InvokeAI, powerful, easy to use and has build-in node system. It is so good that in most cases we have no reason to use SD webui any more.  

If you are not familiar with InvokeAI, you can check this video:

For Model Info Helper, I'm re-designing it into a stand alone model management system, not an extension of SD webui.  

Since it won't be released as estimated, I have updated the old civitai helper 1.x to work with latest SD webui.
